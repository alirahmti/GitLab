   sudo apt install -y postfix
   ```

#### **Step 5: Configure GitLab**
1. Open the GitLab configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
   ```
2. Find the line that starts with `external_url` and set it to your server's domain name or IP address. For example:
   ```ruby
   external_url 'http://your_domain_or_ip'
   ```
3. Save and exit the file.

---

#### **Step 6: Reconfigure GitLab**
1. Apply the configuration changes by running:
   ```bash
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```
   This process may take some time.

---

#### **Step 7: Access GitLab**
1. Open a web browser and navigate to the URL or IP address you set in the `external_url` configuration.
2. On the first login, GitLab will prompt you to set a password for the `root` user.

#### **Step 8: Optional Post-Installation Steps**
- **Enable HTTPS**: If you want to secure your GitLab instance with HTTPS, you can configure SSL certificates in the `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` file.
- **Set Up Backups**: Configure automatic backups to ensure your data is safe.
